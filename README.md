# Moon Base Employee Expense System

## Description
*Welcome* to the **Moon**!

This app is designed to mimic an Employee Expense Reimbursement System. It's got a Front-End built out in JavaScript/HTML/CSS and a Back-End consisting of Java with Javalin in conjunction with a PostgreSQL Database. Thematically, it is based on a hypothetical 'Moon Base' where they conduct who knows what kind of Work and Research. The purpose of doing so was to give me a Theme that I could enjoy playing around with, but other than that, it is just for stylistic reasons. The Core of the Application is a simple Reimbursement Interface that could easily be configured to any style.
